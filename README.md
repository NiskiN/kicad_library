# Shared libraries for SilverSat-specific parts

This repository contains shared libraries for custom Ki-CAD parts developed for the SilverSat PC board designs. There are two libraries in this repository:
  SilverSat_symbols.lib :  custom schematic symbols used while drawing schematics
  SilverSat_footprints.pretty : custom footprints used in PCB layouts.
  
  Note that SilverSat_sybmols.lib is a single file containing all of custom symbols.  SilverSat_footprints.pretty is a folder, and each custom footprint is a separate file.
